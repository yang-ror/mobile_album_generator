# Mobile Album Generator

Let's suppose you have a folder on your computer that contains some valuable memories, and you want to appreciate them on your mobile devices without actually copy to them:

That is where this script should be started in:

Run it (this script does not need to be run again if there's no change in the directory):

This command will run at the end of this script (On Windows, change the command to 'python -m http.server'):

On your mobile devices:
