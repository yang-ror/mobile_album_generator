# Mobile Album Generator

Let's suppose you have a folder on your computer that contains some valuable memories, and you want to appreciate them on your mobile devices without actually copy to them:

That is where this script should be started in:

<img src="https://github.com/yang-ror/mobile_album_generator/blob/main/Screen%20shots/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%2012.07.02%20AM.png" alt="Screen shot" style="width: 100%" />

Run it:

<img src="https://github.com/yang-ror/mobile_album_generator/blob/main/Screen%20shots/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%2012.08.28%20AM.png" alt="Screen shot" style="width: 100%" />

And do as it says:

<img src="https://github.com/yang-ror/mobile_album_generator/blob/main/Screen%20shots/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%2012.08.49%20AM.png" alt="Screen shot" style="width: 100%" />

On your mobile devices:

<img src="https://github.com/yang-ror/mobile_album_generator/blob/main/Screen%20shots/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%2012.08.49%20AM.png" alt="Screen shot" style="width: 100%" />
